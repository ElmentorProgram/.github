# Getting Started

## How to Contribute

Contributing to our repositories typically follows this workflow:

1. **Fork** the repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone** your fork locally and set up the project environment.
3. **Create a new branch** using a meaningful name based on our branching and naming conventions.
4. Make your changes, ensuring they follow our code style, documentation, and testing guidelines.
5. **Commit** your changes with a clear, properly formatted commit message.
6. **Push** the branch to your forked repository.
7. Open a **pull request (PR)** from your branch to the main repository and follow the PR guidelines.

We welcome a variety of contributions, including code changes, documentation updates, issue triage, and feedback during reviews.

## Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:

- A GitHub account and access to the repository.
- Git installed and configured on your local machine.
- Any required tools or SDKs specific to the repository (e.g., .NET SDK, Node.js, Terraform CLI, SQL Server tools, etc.).
- Familiarity with GitHub workflows, pull requests, and branching models.

Refer to the individual repository’s README for any project-specific setup steps.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Each repository **may include** setup scripts or documentation to help you get started. These may include:

- Shell or PowerShell scripts (`setup.sh`, `setup.ps1`) for environment provisioning.  
- Environment variables and `.env` templates.  
- Installation instructions for dependencies.  
- Configuration files for tools such as Terraform, Azure CLI, or database clients.

If you encounter issues during setup, check the repository’s `docs/technical-guides` folder, and review the **Community Engagement** and **Issue Management** sections before asking for support or raising a problem.
