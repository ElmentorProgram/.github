# Elmentor Program
The **Elmentor Program** is an exclusive, global community of approximately 150 members representing over **20 countries**. Our members span a wide range of experience—from early-career professionals with just one to two years in the field, to seasoned experts with **up to 25 years** of deep industry expertise.

At the heart of the Elmentor Program is a clear and simple goal:  
>[!NOTE]
>**To create a space where knowledge is exchanged freely, and continuous learning is not just encouraged—it’s embedded into everything we do.**

## Our Activities

Within the community, members actively engage in various collaborative and developmental activities, including:

- **Sharing job opportunities**  
- **Collaborating on open-source projects**  
- **Organizing study groups**  
- **Discussing real-world use cases and business scenarios**  
- **Exchanging technical and leadership knowledge**  
- **Supporting the wider public community**
- **And many more**

These activities are designed to benefit everyone—from novices to experts—while reinforcing the habit of lifelong learning.

## Understanding Knowledge Access Through Elmentor Circles

To structure access, engagement, and leadership within the community, we use a model called **Elmentor Circles**. These circles define different levels of participation and responsibility, arranged in clear layers:
1. **Audience** – External audience who engage with us from the outside  
2. **Guests** – Occasional participants with limited access  
3. **Members** – Active, permanent participants in the community  
4. **Group Advisory (GAs)** – Leaders who support and guide members  
5. **Lead Group Advisory (LGAs)** – Guide both the Group Advisory and members  
6. **Executives** – Set strategic direction and oversee all layers  

This model helps us structure engagement, learning, and decision-making in a clear and scalable way.

## Code of Conduct

We value respectful and constructive interaction with all audiences. Please read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to understand how we ensure a safe and welcoming environment for everyone.
